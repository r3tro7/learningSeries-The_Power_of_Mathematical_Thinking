## When am I going to use this?

- **Everyday Decision Making**: Ellenberg explains that the principles of mathematics help us assess risks, plan strategies, and understand the likelihood of various outcomes in complex situations.

- **Understanding Data and Statistics**: The author emphasizes the importance of understanding statistics and data interpretation, which are prevalent in news media, healthcare results, and consumer advertisements. Mathematics equips us with the tools to critically evaluate the validity and relevance of statistical claims.

- **Economic Choices**: Ellenberg points out that mathematics is key to making personal and professional economic decisions. Understanding basic concepts of probability and statistical modeling can help in making better investments, saving decisions, and financial planning.

- **Science and Technology**: In the realm of science and technology, mathematical concepts underpin many modern advancements. From engineering projects to software development and scientific research, mathematics forms the backbone of innovation and problem-solving.

- **Social Interactions and Politics**: Mathematics helps parse complex social data to form reasoned arguments and make collective decisions be it voting trends, public policy effectiveness or population dynamics.

- **Sports and Games**: Ellenberg uses examples from sports to show how mathematics can optimize strategies in games and sports competitions. Understanding statistical records and probability can enhance predictions and tactical decisions both in amateur and professional sports.

- **Personal Insight and Growth**: By applying mathematical thinking, individuals can improve their logical reasoning, problem-solving skills, and even their philosophical outlook on life.

### Abraham Wald and the missing bullet holes:
- Abraham Wald, a statistician, was asked to help the military determine how to best armor their aircraft to increase their chances of surviving enemy attacks. The military initially proposed reinforcing areas that showed the most damage on returning planes. However, Wald suggested a counterintuitive approach.
- Key points of Abraham's suggestion:
    - Observation of Damage: Wald noted that the military was only considering planes that returned from missions. These planes represented "survivors."
    - Survivorship Bias: The critical insight was that the areas where these planes showed no damage were likely the areas that, if hit, would cause a plane not to return at all. This is a prime example of survivorship bias, where decisions are made based on an incomplete view of data.
    - Reinforcement Recommendation: Wald recommended reinforcing areas where the returning planes were undamaged, arguing that planes hit in these areas were the ones not making it back.

- Learnings:
    - Survivorship Bias Recognition: It highlights the need to recognize and account for survivorship bias when analyzing data. Decisions should be based on all possible information, including understanding what data might be missing and why.
    - Counterintuitive Thinking: Wald’s approach demonstrates that sometimes the best solutions come from thinking contrary to initial assumptions.
    - Application of Statistical Thinking: This story is a testament to how statistical thinking can lead to better decision-making strategies in critical situations, such as military tactics.

This section of the book fundamentally argues that mathematics is not just an academic subject but a vital skill that enhances our understanding of the world and improves our decision-making capabilities in all aspects of life.
